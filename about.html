        <p>
            Hello! My name is Landon. I am a Software Engineer with a multi-disciplinary background in computer science, music education, and software development.
        </p>
        
        <h2>My Background</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Software Engineer based in Dallas, TX, with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science from Texas State University (Magna Cum Laude, 2023). 
            I also hold a Bachelor of Music in Music Education from Texas Tech University (Cum Laude, 2021). 
        </p>    
        
        <p>
            My journey into tech started in college when I began building my own computers. Eventually, I installed Linux on my desktop and that was the beginning of my love for open source software.
            Since then, I have been customizing my computer to my liking, which has led me to learn a lot about hardware and software.
            My family has influenced me to learn and utilize technology from a young age, which has given me tons of ideas for projects that I can build. 
            For example, my brother asked for a Thermostat to be installed in his house, so I built one using a Raspberry Pi and a temperature sensor.
            All of this started the day I installed Linux on my desktop and I have been hooked ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            My specializations include Linux, Python, web development, backend systems, and Raspberry Pi integrations. I have experience with 
            SaaS development, Kubernetes GitOps, and LLM tooling. Recent work spans enterprise signage (Laravel/PHP), k3s home-lab with FluxCD, 
            observability (Grafana/Prometheus), Raspberry Pi HVAC control, and multi-agent LLM orchestration. I'm particularly interested in 
            embedded systems and hardware/software integrations, which is why I've been diving into Raspberry Pi projects—from the thermostat 
            system to the pan-tilt camera. 
        </p>
